# `angular-pane-manager`

This project is a spiritual successor to [`ng-pane-manager`], ported for use with modern Angular.

```html
<ng-pane-manager class="ng-theme-default" [layout]="myLayout"></ng-pane-manager>

<div *ngPaneTemplate="let pane named foo">
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</p>
</div>

<div *ngPaneTemplate="let pane named bar">
    <h1>Sidebar</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>File</li>
        <li>Edit</li>
        <li>Format</li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

<!--TODO: create an actual sample project-->
An example of `angular-pane-manager` in action can be found at the repository [`angular-pane-manager-example`].  In addition, the repository contains the encapsulating Angular project used for developing this library.  If you would like to contribute to `angular-pane-manager`, the easiest way to get started is by checking it out.

## Installing

To get started, add `@openopus/angular-pane-manager` to your project with your package manager of choice.

## Styling

<!--TODO: verify this with a new sample project-->
This package comes with a basic cosmetic theme, but it is not applied to the pane manager component by default.  This is intentionalâ€”by doing so, you are able to add custom styles to it without having to fight existing CSS importance scores.  To use the default theme from the package, add `class="ng-theme-default"` to your `<ng-pane-manager>` tag, and add the following to your `angular.json`, under the section `projects.[your-project-name].architect.build.options`:

```json
    "styles": [
        "node_modules/@openopus/angular-pane-manager/assets/styles.scss",
        ...
    ]
```

This stylesheet is also a good reference point for creating your own pane manager themes.

## Contributing

To build and test this repository, you can clone the Angular workspace it was originally generated in from the repo [`angular-pane-manager-example`].
