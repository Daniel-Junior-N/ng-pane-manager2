# `angular-pane-manager`

This project is a spiritual successor to [`ng-pane-manager`], ported for use with modern Angular.

Demos of `angular-pane-manager` can be found in the [`examples` folder], showcasing different uses of the library.

The repository [`angular-pane-manager-example`] houses the original Angular workspace for this project, and shows off some more complex examples used to test and develop features of the library itself.

## Getting Started

To install this library, add `@openopus/angular-pane-manager` to your project with your package manager of choice.  A tutorial on how to get started with the library can be found under `examples/01-simple`.

## Styling

This package comes with a basic cosmetic theme, but it is not applied to the pane manager component by default.  This is intentionalâ€”by doing so, you are able to add custom styles to it without having to fight existing CSS importance scores.  To use the default theme from the package, add `class="ng-theme-default"` to your `<ng-pane-manager>` tag, and add the following to your `angular.json`, under the section `projects.[your-project-name].architect.build.options`:

```json
    "styles": [
        "node_modules/@openopus/angular-pane-manager/assets/styles.scss",
        ...
    ]
```

This stylesheet is also a good reference point for creating your own pane manager themes.

## Contributing

To build and test this repository, you can clone the Angular workspace it was originally generated in from the repo [`angular-pane-manager-example`].
